**A real-time simulation/game server with a SignalR interface**

Current Functionality: 
* Basic simulation framework.
* SignalR Hub
* BackGroundService running the sim.
* Object transform (postion, rotation, etc) sync between client and server.

Future Development:
* Simulation components (movement, activities, etc)
* Client (currently using a basic console app as a client)


Note: this is just a fun hobby project and somewhat messy and haphazard as I am not a game dev.
